### 🧑🏻‍💻 About Me 

As a passionate Senior Software Engineer from São Paulo, Brazil, I bring a wealth of technical and business knowledge to the table. With a degree in Analysis and Systems Development and an MBA in DevOps Engineering, I have a solid foundation in both the technical and managerial aspects of software development. Additionally, my Terraform Associate and AWS Developer Associate certifications demonstrate my commitment to staying up-to-date on the latest industry advancements.

Currently, I am a Senior Software Engineer at Stone CO, where I work on developing payment tools for entrepreneurs. Utilizing technologies like Javascript, AWS, Terraform, and serverless architecture, I am responsible for both implementing new features and provisioning the cloud infrastructure.

With over 6 years of experience in the IT industry, I have a proven track record of delivering successful projects. Some of my notable accomplishments include implementing a Member Get Member solution and contributing to the improvement of features for mobile apps at Cielo, Zup, and Stone.co.

My ultimate goal is to continue growing professionally while making a positive impact on society through innovative technology solutions. I am committed to helping people achieve their career aspirations in IT and plan to achieve this by establishing a Tech-school.
